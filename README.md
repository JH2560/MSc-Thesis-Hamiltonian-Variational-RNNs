This repo contains the code associated with the MSc Individual Project titled "Hamiltonian Variational RNNs"

The structure of this repo is as follows:
- train_hvrnn.py contains the code required to train the HVRNN.
- train_vrnn.py contains the code required to train the VRNN.
- -hnn_model.py contains the code for the HNN.
- helper_functions.py contains a set of globally used functions (e.g., loss calculations)
- The Library folder contains the code from the repo "Hamiltonian-Generative-Networks", by Canal et al. Minor adjustments have been made to some files to integrate with our own files (e.g., path changes).

Note: This repo was updated prior to final commit, as such the current hyperparameters are the ones used to check the scripts still worked. Please change the hyperparameters prior to use. If there are any issues with the scripts, please let me know (as I may have accidentally deleted something during clean-up).
